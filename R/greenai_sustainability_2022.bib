	abstract = {Searching for the optimal values of hyperparameters of a Machine Learning algorithm can be an extremely computationally expensive and awfully energivorous process. This paper proposes multi information source optimization as a strategy to drastically reduce computational time and energy consumed by this search process, where the information sources, with different computational costs, are smaller portions of a large dataset. The algorithm fits into the scheme of Gaussian Process based Bayesian optimization: an Augmented Gaussian Process is proposed, which is trained using only 'reliable' information among available sources. A novel acquisition function is also defined according to the Augmented Gaussian Process. Results on the hyperparameter optimization of a Support Vector Machine for a classification task on a large dataset are presented, with a comparison in terms of the misclassification error, on 10 fold-cross validation, and computational cost between the proposed approach and traditional hyperparameter optimization using the entire dataset. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {So far, little effort has been devoted to developing practical approaches on how to develop and deploy AI systems that meet certain standards and principles. This is despite the importance of principles such as privacy, fairness, and social equality taking centre stage in discussions around AI. However, for an organization, failing to meet those standards can give rise to significant lost opportunities. It may further lead to an organization's demise, as the example of Cambridge Analytica demonstrates. It is, however, possible to pursue a practical approach for the design, development, and deployment of sustainable AI systems that incorporates both business and human values and principles. This book discusses the concept of sustainability in the context of artificial intelligence. In order to help businesses achieve this objective, the author introduces the sustainable artificial intelligence framework (SAIF), designed as a reference guide in the development and deployment of AI systems. The SAIF developed in the book is designed to help decision makers such as policy makers, boards, C-suites, managers, and data scientists create AI systems that meet ethical principles. By focusing on four pillars related to the socio-economic and political impact of AI, the SAIF creates an environment through which an organization learns to understand its risk and exposure to any undesired consequences of AI, and the impact of AI on its ability to create value in the short, medium, and long term. What You Will Learn • See the relevance of ethics to the practice of data science and AI • Examine the elements that enable AI within an organization • Discover the challenges of developing AI systems that meet certain human or specific standards • Explore the challenges of AI governance • Absorb the key factors to consider when evaluating AI systems Who This Book Is For Decision makers such as government officials, members of the C-suite and other business managers, and data scientists as well as any technology expert aspiring to a data-related leadership role. © 2021 by Ghislain Landry Tsafack Chetsa.

	abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically of Deep Learning (DL), in modern software systems, is nowadays widespread and continues to grow. At the same time, its usage is energy de-manding and contributes to the increased CO2 emissions, and has a great financial cost as well. Even though there are many studies that examine the capabilities of DL, only a few focus on its green aspects, such as energy consumption. This paper aims at raising awareness of the costs incurred when using different DL frameworks. To this end, we perform a thorough empirical study to measure and compare the energy consumption and run-time performance of six different DL models written in the two most popular DL frameworks, namely PYTORCH and TENSORFLOW. We use a well-known benchmark of DL models, Deep LEARNINGEXAMPLES, created by NVIDIA, to compare both the training and inference costs of DL. Finally, we manually investigate the functions of these frameworks that took most of the time to execute in our experiments. The results of our empirical study reveal that there is a statistically significant difference between the cost incurred by the two DL frameworks in 94% of the cases studied. While Tensorflow achieves significantly better energy and run-time performance than PYTORCH, and with large effect sizes in 100% of the cases for the training phase, PYTORCH instead exhibits significantly better energy and run-time performance than TENSORFLOW in the inference phase for 66% of the cases, always, with large effect sizes. Such a large difference in performance costs does not, however, seem to affect the accuracy of the models produced, as both frameworks achieve comparable scores under the same configurations. Our manual analysis, of the documentation and source code of the functions examined, reveals that such a difference in performance costs is under-documented, in these frameworks. This suggests that developers need to improve the documentation of their DL frameworks, the source code of the functions used in these frameworks, as well as to enhance existing DL algorithms. © 2022 ACM.},

However, most AI-driven applications need high-end servers to process complex AI tasks, bringing high energy consumption to IIoT environments. In this article, we introduce intelligent edge computing, emerging technology to reduce energy consumption in processing AI tasks, to build green AI computing for IIoT applications. We first propose an intelligent edge computing framework with a heterogeneous architecture to offload most AI tasks from servers. To enhance the energy efficiency of various computing resources, we propose a novel algorithm to optimize the scheduling for different AI tasks. In the performance evaluation, we build a small testbed to show the AI-driven IIoT applications' energy efficiency with intelligent edge computing. Meanwhile, extensive simulation results show that the proposed online scheduling strategy consumes less than 80% energy of the static scheduling and 70% of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) strategy in most settings.  © 2017 IEEE.},

However, AI may also lead to patient harm due to fatal glitches in robotic surgery, bias in diagnosis, or dangerous recommendations. Despite concerns ethicists have identified in the use of AI in health care, the most significant consideration ought not be vulnerabilities in the software, but the environmental impact of AI. Health care emits a significant amount of carbon in many countries. As AI becomes an essential part of health care, ethical reflection must include the potential to negatively impact the environment. As such, this article will first overview the carbon emissions in health care. It will, second, offer five reasons why carbon calculations are insufficient to address sustainability in health care. Third, the article will derive normative concepts from the goals of medicine, the principles of biomedical ethics, and green bioethics—the very locus in which AI in health care sits—to propose health, justice, and resource conservation as criteria for sustainable AI in health care. In the fourth and final part of the article, examples of sustainable and unsustainable development and use of AI in health care will be evaluated through the three-fold lens of health, justice, and resource conservation. With various ethical approaches to AI in health care, the imperative for environmental sustainability must be underscored, lest carbon emissions continue to increase, harming people and planet alike. © 2022 The Authors.

The following areas are identified as having particular importance: (1) socially emotional, ethical, and moral AI, (2) self-developing and self-sustainable AI, and (3) human-analogous AI, inspired by the human psychology. As a result, a general concept is formulated with the intent to clarify and unify the currently popular slogans, including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Strong AI, Human-Level or Humanlike AI (HLAI), Brain-Inspired or Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA), and more. The key idea of the proposed concept is that future AI must open a new angle of view and new perspectives to humans, thereby enriching and transforming the society, helping it to solve its problems and taking the civilization to a new level. While being created by humans, for humans, and fully compatible with humans at the social level, it will not be "a human in silicon", but rather an "alien": Intelligent, friendly, and welcome. Its principles will combine preprogrammed basic functions and its own natural ontogeny in a virtual social environment. Forms of implementation will range from virtual entities to wearable electronics and autonomous robots. The expected impact on the society will be immense and crucial for its survival. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At present we are witnessing a tremendous interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Deep Learning (DL)/Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the reasons appears to be the unmatched performance achieved by such systems. This has resulted in an enormous hope on such techniques and often these are viewed as all—cure solutions. But most of these systems cannot explain why a particular decision is made (black box) and sometimes miserably fail in cases where other systems would not. Consequently, in critical applications such as healthcare and defense practitioners do not like to trust such systems. Although an AI system is often designed taking inspiration from the brain, there is not much attempt to exploit cues from the brain in true sense. In our opinion, to realize intelligent systems with human like reasoning ability, we need to exploit knowledge from the brain science. Here we discuss a few findings in brain science that may help designing intelligent systems. We explain the relevance of transparency, explainability, learning from a few examples, and the trustworthiness of an AI system. We also discuss a few ways that may help to achieve these attributes in a learning system. © Copyright © 2020 Pal.},

The effectiveness of medicine more in general depends in turn on active cooperation and trust between clinician and patient. From the second half of the 20th century, the art of medicine is challenged by the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, recently showing comparable performances to flesh-and-bone doctors in some diagnostic specialties. Being the principle source of data in medicine, the laboratory is a natural ground where AI technologies can disclose the best of their potential. In order to maximize the expected outcomes and minimize risks, it is crucial to define ethical requirements for data collection and interpretation by-design, clarify whether they are enhanced or challenged by specific uses of AI technologies, and preserve these data under rigorous but feasible norms. From 2018 onwards, the European Commission (EC) is making efforts to lay the foundations of sustainable AI development among European countries and partners, both from a cultural and a normative perspective. Alongside with the work of the EC, the United Kingdom provided worthy-considering complementary advice in order to put science and technology at the service of patients and doctors.

However, these state-of-the-art NMT models need much more computing power and data than SMT models, a requirement that is unsustainable in the long run and of very limited benefit in low-resource scenar-ios. To some extent, model compression—more specifically state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques—can remedy this. In this work, we investigate knowledge distillation on a simulated low-resource German-to-English translation task. We show that sequence-level knowledge distillation can be used to train small student models on knowledge distilled from large teacher models. Part of this work examines the influence of hyperparameter tuning on model performance when lowering the number of Transformer heads or limiting the vocabulary size. Interestingly, the accuracy of these student models is higher than that of the teachers in some cases even though the student model training times are shorter in some cases. In a novel contribution, we demonstrate for a specific MT service provider that in the post-deployment phase, distilled student models can reduce emissions, as well as cost purely in monetary terms, by almost 50%. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision aids are increasingly employed by businesses to assist consumers’ decision-making. Personalized content based on consumers’ data brings benefits for both consumers and businesses, i.e., with regards to more relevant content. However, this practice simultaneously enables increased possibilities for exerting hidden interference and manipulation on consumers, reducing consumer autonomy. We argue that due to this, consumer autonomy represents a resource at the risk of depletion and requiring protection, due to its fundamental sig-nificance for a democratic society. By balancing advantages and disadvantages of increased influence by AI, this paper addresses an important research gap and explores the essential challenges related to the use of AI for consumers’ decision-making and autonomy, grounded in extant litera-ture. We offer a constructive, rather than optimistic or pessimistic, outlook on AI. Hereunder, we present propositions suggesting how these problems may be alleviated, and how consumer autonomy may be protected. These propositions constitute the fundament for a framework regarding the development of sustainable AI, in the context of online decision-making. We argue that notions of transparency, complementarity, and privacy regulation are vital for increasing consumer autonomy and promoting sustainable AI. Lastly, the paper offers a definition of sustainable AI within the con-textual boundaries of online decision-making. Altogether, we position this paper as a contribution to the discussion of development towards a more socially sustainable and ethical use of AI. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become commonplace in addressing major challenges in computer vision. Researchers are not only coming up with new CNN architectures but are also researching different techniques to improve the performance of existing architectures. However, there is a tendency to over-emphasize performance improvement while neglecting certain important variables such as simplicity, versatility, the fairness of comparisons, and energy efficiency. Overlooking these variables in architectural design and evaluation has led to research bias and a significantly negative environmental impact. Furthermore, this can undermine the positive impact of research in using deep learning models to tackle climate change. Here, we perform an extensive and fair empirical study of a number of proposed techniques to gauge the utility of each technique for segmentation and classification. Our findings restate the importance of favoring simplicity over complexity in model design (Occam’s Razor). Furthermore, our results indicate that simple standardized practices can lead to a significant reduction in environmental impact with little drop in performance. We highlight that there is a need to rethink the design and evaluation of CNNs to alleviate the issue of research bias and carbon emissions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Artificial intelligence in various fields can achieve better performance than traditional methods, but to achieve the industrialization standard of Green AI, we need further research. Accordingly, we introduce a multi-layer contrastive learning method to a lightweight target detection model design, which is applied to real aero-engine borescope images of complex components to accomplish real-time damage detection. We intensively conduct comparative experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The verification results demonstrate that the method can help our model perform excellently compared with other available baseline models. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years and the subsequent increase in complexity of the applied models, the growing demand in computational resources is starting to pose a significant challenge. The need for higher compute power is being met with increasingly more potent accelerator hardware as well as the use of large and powerful compute clusters. However, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on distributed and accelerated systems ultimately comes at the price of a substantial increase in energy demand, and researchers have started questioning the environmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, awareness of energy efficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and hardware infrastructure operators likewise. The energy consumption of AI workloads depends both on the model implementation and the composition of the utilized hardware. Therefore, accurate measurements of the power draw of respective AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to algorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and hardware. Towards this end, we present measurements of the energy consumption of two typical applications of deep learning models on different types of heterogeneous compute nodes. Our results indicate that 1. contrary to common approaches, deriving energy consumption directly from runtime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be considered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on mixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy consumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be considered separately – while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types regarding both runtime and energy consumption, inference on CPU nodes can be comparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is the fact that the information on energy consumption is available to all users of the supercomputer and not just those with administrator rights, enabling an easy transfer to other workloads alongside a raise in user-awareness of energy consumption. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNN) have been applied recently to different domains and perform better than classical state-of-the-art methods. However the high level of performances of DNNs is most often obtained with networks containing millions of parameters and for which training requires substantial computational power. To deal with this computational issue proximal regularization methods have been proposed in the literature but they are time consuming. In this paper, we propose instead a constrained approach. We provide the general framework for this new projection gradient method. Our algorithm iterates a gradient step and a projection on convex constraints. We studied algorithms for different constraints: the classical ℓ1 unstructured constraint and structured constraints such as the ℓ2,1 constraint (Group LASSO). We propose a new ℓ1,1 structured constraint for which we provide a new projection algorithm. Finally, we used the recent "Lottery optimizer" replacing the threshold by our ℓ1,1 projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with three popular datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR). Experiments with these datasets show that our projection method using this new ℓ1,1 structured constraint provides the best decrease in memory and computational power. © 2020 IEEE},

	abstract = {Recently, attention has been drawn to the sustainability of artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of environmental costs. However, sustainability is not tantamount to the reduction of environmental costs. By shifting the focus to intergenerational justice as one of the constitutive normative pillars of sustainability, the paper identifies a reductionist view on the sustainability of AI and constructively contributes a conceptual extension. It further develops a framework that establishes normative issues of intergenerational justice raised by the uses of AI. The framework reveals how using AI for decision support to policies with long-term impacts can negatively affect future persons. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that uses of AI for decision support to policies of environmental protection or climate mitigation include assumptions about social discounting and future persons’ preferences. These assumptions are highly controversial and have a significant influence on the weight assigned to the potentially detrimental impacts of a policy on future persons. Furthermore, these underlying assumptions are seldom transparent within AI. Subsequently, the analysis provides a list of assessment questions that constitutes a guideline for the revision of AI techniques in this regard. In so doing, insights about how AI can be made more sustainable become apparent. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Research has highlighted the immense carbon footprint of machine learning (ML) driven applications, due to the extraordinary growth in the size of deep learning models, which are estimated to have grown by a factor of 300,000 over the last six years. This is a concern, so we wish to add our voice to a growing community of responsible AI researchers and practitioners and help highlight how energy awareness and responsible best practices can be used to enhance the environmental sustainability of AI.

	abstract = {The generation of music lyrics by artificial intelligence (AI) is frequently modeled as a language-targeted sequence-to-sequence generation task. Formally, if we convert the melody into a word sequence, we can consider the lyrics generation task to be a machine translation task. Traditional machine translation tasks involve translating between cross-lingual word sequences, whereas music lyrics generation tasks involve translating between music and natural language word sequences. The theme or key words of the generated lyrics are usually limited to meet the needs of the users when they are generated. This requirement can be thought of as a restricted translation problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy training framework that allows a model to simultaneously support both unrestricted and restricted translation by adopting an additional auxiliary training process without constraining the decoding process. This maintains the benefits of restricted translation but greatly reduces the extra time overhead of constrained decoding, thus improving its practicality. The experimental results show that our framework is well suited to the Chinese lyrics generation and restricted machine translation tasks, and that it can also generate language sequence under the condition of given restricted words without training multiple models, thereby achieving the goal of green AI.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We look into different types of control methods, including fixed time, adaptive, analytic, and reinforcement learning approaches. Machine learning approaches are compared with the ‘‘analytic’’ approach, which is used as ‘‘gold standard’’ for performance assessment. We find that conventional machine learning approaches are better than the analytic approach, but require a lot more computer power. We, therefore, introduce a novel hybrid method called ‘‘analytically guided reinforcement learning’’ or shorter ‘‘α-RL’’. This approach is implemented in our ‘‘GuidedLight agent’’ and tends to outperform both, classical machine learning and the analytic approach, while largely improving convergence. This method is therefore suited as a ‘‘green IT’’ solution that improves environmental impact in a two-fold way: by reducing (i) traffic congestion and (ii) the processing power needed for the learning and operation of the traffic light control algorithm. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, the performance of these systems may drastically deteriorate when the data are perturbed, or the environment dynamically changes, either due to natural effects or caused by manmade disturbances. The challenges are especially daunting in edge computing scenarios and on-board applications with limited resources, due to constraints on the available data, energy, computational power, while critical decisions must be made rapidly, in a robust way. A neuromorphic perspective provides crucial support under such conditions. Human brains are efficient devices using 20W power (just like a light bulb!), which is drastically less than the power consumption of today's supercomputers requiring MWs to solve specific learning tasks in an innovative way. This is not sustainable. Brains use spatio-temporal oscillations to implement pattern-based computing, going beyond the sequential symbol manipulation paradigm of traditional Turing machines. Neuromorphic spiking chips, including memristor technology, provide crucial support to the field.

The European Union (EU) is committed to the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which the UN itself has recognized cannot be achieved without a people-focused, science-based, digital revolution [2]. This commitment to the 2030 Agenda should entail promoting an inclusive and sustainable AI strategy, rather than a strategy with a narrow focus on competitiveness [3], [4]. In order for AI to contribute to achieving the SDGs, a systemic approach to the development of AI solutions is required [5]-[9]. Conversely, the SDGs provide an ideal framework to test the desirability of AI solutions [10]. Europe's multicultural character and its framework of international collaboration give it a head start toward becoming a global reference in the promotion of an inclusive and sustainable AI. Sharing the experiences and practices of such a European AI could make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Meanwhile, despite of its well-claimed potential to transform cloud and IoT industry, Edge AI is still a complex subject that faces critical challenges from the trustworthy and sustainable concerns. To shed light on these pressing matters, this paper aims to develop a research agenda for trustworthy and sustainable Edge AI. We clarify the concepts, define the proper scoping and propose a research agenda for Edge AI to be trustworthy and sustainable. To illustrate the research agenda in practice, we highlight two active RD projects: the SPATIAL project on trustworthy Edge AI and the APROPOS project on sustainable computing. The projects serve as concrete use cases to explore the agenda development. Our goal is to equip researchers, engineers, service providers, government and public sectors with a better understanding of the underlying concepts and to raise awareness of emerging directions in trustworthy and sustainable Edge AI.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its manifold applications have fueled the discussion around how AI can be used to facilitate sustainable objectives. However, the technical, ethical, and legal literature on how AI, including its design, training, implementation, and use can be sustainable, is rather limited. At the same time, consumers incrementally pay more attention to sustainability information, whereas businesses are increasingly engaging in greenwashing practices, especially in relation to digital products and services, raising concerns about the efficiency of the existing consumer protection framework in this regard. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the discussion toward sustainable AI from a legal and consumer protection standpoint while focusing on the environmental and societal pillar of sustainability. After analyzing the multidisciplinary literature available on the topic of the environmentally sustainable AI lifecycle, as well as the latest EU policies and initiatives regarding consumer protection and sustainability, we will examine whether the current consumer protection framework is sufficient to promote sharing and substantiation of sustainability information in B2C contracts involving AI products and services. Moreover, we will assess whether AI-related AI initiatives can promote a sustainable AI development. Finally, we will propose a set of recommendations capable of encouraging a sustainable and environmentally-conscious AI lifecycle while enhancing information transparency among stakeholders, aligning the various EU policies and initiatives, and ultimately empowering consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

Accordingly, the sustainable AI-STEAM course with the experiential learning framework has been implemented and verified, so as to confirm that the AI-STEAM course is not too difficult for young students. Many basic concepts involved in the AI-STEAM course, regarding programming logic, electromechanical concepts, interface design, and the application of image recognition, were measured in this study. The results showed that the students not only made significant progress in learning effectiveness, but also in particular made significant improvements in two parts: electromechanical concepts and image recognition knowledge. In the end, this study further provides some advice on the sustainable AI-STEAM course based on the survey of some important factors including active learning, and self-efficacy after confirming that it is not a barrier for the young students to learn the sustainable AI-STEAM course developed in this study. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for the infrastructures that support many of society’s functions. Transportation, security, energy, education, the workplace, the government have all incorporated AI into their infrastructures for enhancement and/or protection. In this paper, we argue that not only is AI seen as a tool for augmenting existing infrastructures, but AI itself is becoming an infrastructure that many services of today and tomorrow will depend upon. Considering the vast environmental consequences associated with the development and use of AI, of which the world is only starting to learn, the necessity of addressing AI alongside the concept of infrastructure points toward the phenomenon of carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in refers to society’s constrained ability to reduce carbon emissions technologically, economically, politically, and socially. These constraints are due to the inherent inertia created by entrenched technological, institutional, and behavioral norms. That is, the drive for AI adoption in virtually every sector of society will create dependencies and interdependencies from which it will be hard to escape. The crux of this paper boils down to this: in conceptualizing AI as infrastructure we can recognize the risk of lock-in, not just carbon lock-in but lock-in as it relates to all the physical needs to achieve the infrastructure of AI. This does not exclude the possibility of solutions arising with the rise of these technologies; however, given these points, it is of the utmost importance that we ask inconvenient questions regarding these environmental costs before becoming locked into this new AI infrastructure. © 2022 by the authors.

There are considerable barriers to overcome, including the existing practices of technology education and teachers’ knowledge of AI. Research evidence shows that studying teachers’ experiences can be beneficial in informing how appropriate design in teaching sustainable AI should evolve. Design frames characterize teachers’ design reasoning and can substantially influence their AI lesson design considerations. This study examined 18 experienced teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI and identi-fied effective designs to support AI instruction. Data collection methods involved semi-structured interviews, action study, classroom observation, and post-lesson discussions with the purpose of analyzing the teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI. Grounded theory was employed to detail how teachers understand the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI and the emerging pedagogical solutions from their perspectives. Results reveal that effective AI instructional design should encompass five important components: (1) obstacles to and facilitators of participation in teaching AI, (2) interactive design thinking processes, (3) teachers’ knowledge of teaching AI, (4) orienteering AI knowledge for social good, and (5) the holistic understanding of teaching AI.

	abstract = {Prognostics and Health Monitoring (PHM) of machinery is a research area with great relevance to industrial applications as it can serve as a foundation for safer, more cost-efficient operation and maintenance. The prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays an important part in this field and has seen significant advances from the introduction of machine learning methods. However, these methods typically require model training with a large number of run-to-failure sequences, which are often not feasible to obtain due to the required time and cost investments. The present study addresses this issue by introducing a novel methodology, which first quantifies the deviation from the machine's health and fault state and then calculates a machine Health Index (HI) prior to the prediction of RUL. In addition, the start of a degradation state is determined. Alternative implementations of the proposed methodology are compared utilising several methods, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network (NN), Mahalanobis Distance (MD), and LSTM Autoencoder (AE) NN. The methodology is applied to the open turbofan degradation (C-MAPSS) and bearing vibration (FEMTO-ST PROGNOSTIA) datasets. When a reduced subset of training sequences is used, the prediction results demonstrate that the proposed methodology largely outperforms the baseline method without HI generation. For example, when comparing prediction errors of the C-MAPSS dataset at a reduction of the available number of training sequences to 5%, the proposed method shows an average prediction improvement by 6.5% - 19.2% relative to the baseline method. The presented approach is therefore suitable to improve model generalisation for cases with a limited number of training sequences. When the full training set is utilised, the most resource-saving variant of the proposed approach achieves an average training duration of 8.9% compared to the baseline method. Hence, an additional contribution of the presented data-efficient approach is the reduction of required computing resources, which has implications on training time, energy consumption, and environmental impact.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully delivered cutting-edge performance in several fields. With the broader deployment of DNN models on critical applications, the security of DNNs has become an active and yet nascent area. Attacks against DNNs can have catastrophic results, according to recent studies. Poisoning attacks, including backdoor attacks and Trojan attacks, are one of the growing threats against DNNs. Having a wide-angle view of these evolving threats is essential to better understand the security issues. In this regard, creating a semantic model and a knowledge graph for poisoning attacks can reveal the relationships between attacks across intricate data to enhance the security knowledge landscape. In this paper, we propose a DNN poisoning attack ontology (DNNPAO) that would enhance knowledge sharing and enable further advancements in the field. To do so, we have performed a systematic review of the relevant literature to identify the current state. We collected 28,469 papers from the IEEE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, and from these papers, 712 research papers were screened in a rigorous process, and 55 poisoning attacks in DNNs were identified and classified. We extracted a taxonomy of the poisoning attacks as a scheme to develop DNNPAO. Subsequently, we used DNNPAO as a framework by which to create a knowledge base. Our findings open new lines of research within the field of AI security. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {‘Sustainable AI’ sets itself apart from other AI ethics frameworks by its inherent regard for the ecological costs of AI, a concern that has so far been woefully overlooked in the policy space. Recently, two German-based research and advocacy institutions have published a joint report on Sustainability Criteria for Artificial Intelligence. This is, to our knowledge, the first AI ethics document in the policy space that puts sustainability at the center of its considerations. We take this as an opportunity to highlight the foundational problems we see in current debates about AI ethics guidelines. Although we do believe the concept of sustainability has the potential to introduce a paradigm shift, we question whether the suggestions and conceptual grounding found in this report have the strength to usher it in. We show this by presenting this new report as an example of current approaches to AI ethics and identify the problems of this approach, which we will describe as ‘checklist ethics’ and ‘ethics of carefulness’. We argue to opt for an ‘ethics of desirability’ approach. This can be completed, we suggest, by reconceptualizing sustainability as a property of complex systems. Finally, we offer a set of indications for further research. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the dire need for a platform that efficiently provides a framework for running reinforcement learning (RL) experiments. We propose the CaiRL Environment Toolkit as an efficient, compatible, and more sustainable alternative for training learning agents and propose methods to develop more efficient environment simulations. There is an increasing focus on developing sustainable artificial intelligence. However, little effort has been made to improve the efficiency of running environment simulations. The most popular development toolkit for reinforcement learning, OpenAI Gym, is built using Python, a powerful but slow programming language. We propose a toolkit written in C++ with the same flexibility level but works orders of magnitude faster to make up for Python's inefficiency. This would drastically cut climate emissions. CaiRL also presents the first reinforcement learning toolkit with a built-in JVM and Flash support for running legacy flash games for reinforcement learning research. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CaiRL in the classic control benchmark, comparing the execution speed to OpenAI Gym. Furthermore, we illustrate that CaiRL can act as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI Gym to leverage significantly faster training speeds because of the reduced environment computation time.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have amassed unprecedented success in information processing ranging from image recognition to time series prediction. The success can largely be attributed to the availability of large datasets for training and the increased complexity of the models. Unfortunately, for some applications only a limited amount of samples is available for training. Fewer training samples increases the risk of over-fitting and poor generalization especially in high complexity models. Moreover, complex models with a large number of trainable parameters require more energy to train and optimize compared to simpler ones. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first use of ANNs for Early Stage Alzheimer Disease classification (ES-AD) from the handwriting (HW). We propose using a framework for building Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) known as Reservoir Computing (RC), both numerically and experimentally, that simplifies training by optimizing the output layer only. We also propose the Bidirectional Long Term Short Term (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods for comparison. For a fairer comparison, we not only consider the accuracies but also the energy costs incurred to obtain the respective accuracies in order to assess the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our numerical and experimental results show that RC yields a classification accuracy of 85%, which is 3% worse than that of BiLSTM and 2% better than that of CNN, at a relatively lower training and significantly lower inference costs. We hope that our findings highlight the importance of examining the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of various models in the community in order to reduce the overall impact of ANNs training on the environment.  © 2013 IEEE.},

First, DefakeHop examines three facial regions (i.e., two eyes and mouth) while DefakeHop++ includes eight more landmarks for broader coverage. Second, for discriminant features selection, DefakeHop uses an unsupervised approach while DefakeHop++ adopts a more effective approach with supervision, called the Discriminant Feature Test (DFT). In DefakeHop++, rich spatial and spectral features are first derived from facial regions and landmarks automatically. Then, DFT is used to select a subset of discriminant features for classifier training. As compared with MobileNet v3 (a lightweight CNN model of 1.5M parameters targeting at mobile applications), DefakeHop++ has a model of 238K parameters, which is 16% of MobileNet v3. Furthermore, DefakeHop++ outperforms MobileNet v3 in Deepfake image detection performance in a weakly-supervised setting. © 2022 H.-S. Chen, S. Hu, S. You and C.-C. J. Kuo.},

	abstract = {The inevitable rise and development of artificial intelligence (AI) was not a sudden occurrence. The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness on the need for a more comprehensive approach on the interdependence between artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental sustainability. It provides an overview of existing sustainable AI policy initiatives at the national and regional level. More precisely, it discusses whether existing European Union (EU) environmental policies are suitable for the AI era or whether new regulations are needed in this field. Finally, this paper assesses cross-fertilisation opportunities between the EU and non-EU countries. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a qualitative analysis of sustainable applications of AI and the sustainability of AI. Emphasis is laid on the latter, and a “sustainable by design” approach is proposed, which in essence is a prerequisite for transparent, responsible and human-centred AI systems. The analysis primarily focuses on environmental sustainability. Findings: The majority of studies focus on how to use AI to protect the environment with very little attention paid to sustainable design of AI. On the other hand, the EU’s comprehensive approach towards sustainable AI is closest to promoting “sustainable by design” AI. Several ways have been identified in which the EU’s actions can be translated beyond its borders. Research limitations/implications: One of the largest limitations of this study is its moderate scope. This paper is confined to the EU and as such provides a limited assessment of global policies and measures on the interplay between sustainability and AI. Consequently, the paper did not provide an in-depth analysis of environmental policies worldwide that could help provide a better picture of possible cooperation areas or common grounds. Another limitation of this study is that it primarily focuses on environmental aspects and as such accords little attention to the economic and social pillars of sustainability. Social implications: With less than 10 years to go before reaching the sustainable development goal deadline, this study can help stakeholders better understand what is being done worldwide in terms of sustainable AI. Moreover, given that the technology is still in its early phase, this study can inspire a “sustainable by design” approach to the development of AI technologies. Originality/value: All national AI strategies published by 1 June 2021 were analysed to identify whether and to what extent they prioritise the interplay between environment and AI. Furthermore, the authors also looked at the EU policy and how it aims to address AI from a sustainable perspective. © 2022, Natasa Perucica and Katarina Andjelkovic.},

	abstract = {Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Surrogate-based optimisation (SBO) algorithms are a powerful technique that combine machine learning and optimisation to solve expensive optimisation problems. This type of problem appears when dealing with computationally expensive simulators or algorithms. By approximating the expensive part of the optimisation problem with a surrogate, the number of expensive function evaluations can be reduced. This paper defines sustainable SBO, which consists of three aspects: applying SBO to a sustainable application, reducing the number of expensive function evaluations, and considering the computational effort of the machine learning and optimisation parts of SBO. The paper reviews sustainable applications that have successfully applied SBO over the past years, and analyses the used framework, type of surrogate used, sustainable SBO aspects, and open questions. This leads to recommendations for researchers working on sustainability-related applications who want to apply SBO, as well as recommendations for SBO researchers. It is argued that transparency of the computation resources used in the SBO framework, as well as developing SBO techniques that can deal with a large number of variables and objectives, can lead to more sustainable SBO. © 2022 by the author.

RGPNet consists of a light-weight asymmetric encoder-decoder and an adaptor. The adaptor helps preserve and refine the abstract concepts from multiple levels of distributed representations between encoder and decoder. It also facilitates the gradient flow from deeper layers to shallower layers. Our experiments demonstrate that RGPNet can generate segmentation results in real-time with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art non-real-time heavy models. Moreover, towards green AI, we show that using an optimized label-relaxation technique with progressive resizing can reduce the training time by up to 60% while preserving the performance. We conclude that RGPNet obtains a better speed-accuracy trade-off across multiple datasets. © 2021 IEEE.},

In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. In addition to its theoretical contribution to scientific research on sustainable artificial intelligence in energy management, the research utilizes a novel topic modeling method in exploring scientific texts and identifying challenges and possible solutions. A variety of solutions was incorporated, including huggingface tool or elbow method, to address these challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Two central concerns that have emerged in this respect are that the optimized goals behind the data processing of AI applications usually remain opaque and the energy footprint of their data processing is growing quickly. This study thus explores how much people value the transparency and environmental sustainability of AI using the example of personal AI assistants. The results from a choice-based conjoint analysis with a sample of more than 1.000 respondents from Germany indicate that people hardly care about the energy efficiency of AI; and while they do value transparency through explainable AI, this added value of an application is offset by minor costs. The findings shed light on what kinds of AI people are likely to demand and have important implications for policy and regulation. © The Author(s) 2022.},

There is a tremendous opportunity to reduce the computational cost and environmental impact of deep learning by accelerating neural network architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, as well as explicitly designing neural architectures that optimize for both energy efficiency and performance. Here, we introduce a framework called training performance estimation (TPE), which builds upon existing techniques for training speed estimation in order to monitor energy consumption and rank model performance-without training models to convergence-saving up to 90% of time and energy of the full training budget. We benchmark TPE in the computationally intensive, well-studied domain of computer vision and in the emerging field of graph neural networks for machine-learned inter-atomic potentials, an important domain for scientific discovery with heavy computational demands. We propose variants of early stopping that generalize this common regularization technique to account for energy costs and study the energy costs of deploying increasingly complex, knowledge-informed architectures for AI-accelerated molecular dynamics and image classification. Our work enables immediate, significant energy savings across the entire pipeline of model development and deployment and suggests new research directions for energy-aware, knowledge-informed model architecture development.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The bilevel approach is connected to both approaches and consists first in devising a parametric formulation of the variational problem, then in optimizing these parameters with respect to a given dataset of training data. In this work we analyze the classical bilevel approach in combination with unrolling techniques, where the parameters of the variational problem are trained with respect to the results obtained after a fixed number of iterations of an optimization method applied to it. This results in a large scale optimization problem which can be solved by means of stochastic methods; as we observed in our numerical experiments, the stochastic approach can produce medium accuracy results in very few epochs. Moreover, our experiments also show that the unrolling approach leads to results which are comparable with those of the original bilevel method in terms of accuracy. © 2022 European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO.

A strategy which has been recently gaining importance to drastically reduce computational time and energy consumed is to exploit the availability of different information sources, with different computational costs and different “fidelity,” typically smaller portions of a large dataset. The multi-source optimization strategy fits into the scheme of Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization. An Augmented Gaussian Process method exploiting multiple information sources (namely, AGP-MISO) is proposed. The Augmented Gaussian Process is trained using only “reliable” information among available sources. A novel acquisition function is defined according to the Augmented Gaussian Process. Computational results are reported related to the optimization of the hyperparameters of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using two sources: a large dataset—the most expensive one—and a smaller portion of it. A comparison with a traditional Bayesian Optimization approach to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVM classifier on the large dataset only is reported. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the changing social and economic environment, organisations are keen to act promptly and appropriately to changes. Sentiment analysis can be applied to social media data to capture timely information of new events and the corresponding public opinions. However, currently both the social topics and trending words are changing just as rapidly as the target topics and domains that organisations are interested in investigating. Therefore, there is a need for a well-trained sentiment analysis model able to handle out-of-domain input. Current solutions mainly focus on using domain adaptation techniques, but these solutions require domain-specific data and inevitably introduce extra overheads. To tackle this challenge, we propose a green Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution for a sentiment analysis pipeline (GreenSAP) to gain a better understanding of the changing public opinions on social media. Specifically, we propose to leverage the expressively powerful capability of the pre-trained Transformer encoder, and make use of several publicly-available sentiment analysis datasets from various domains and scenarios to develop a pipeline model. A sarcasm detection model is also included to eliminate false positive predictions. In experiments, this model significantly outperforms its competitors on three public benchmark datasets and on two of our labelled out-of-domain datasets for real-world applications. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Scalable and sustainable AI-driven analytics are necessary to enable large-scale and heterogeneous service deployment in sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense networks. This implies that the exchange of raw monitoring data should be minimized across the network by bringing the analysis functions closer to the data collection points. While federated learning (FL) is an efficient tool to implement such a decentralized strategy, real networks are generally characterized by time- and space-varying traffic patterns and channel conditions, making thereby the data collected in different points non independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which is challenging for FL. To sidestep this issue, we first introduce a new a priori metric that we call dataset entropy, whose role is to capture the distribution, the quantity of information, the unbalanced structure and the “non-IIDness” of a dataset independently of the models. This a priori entropy is calculated using a multi-dimensional spectral clustering scheme over both the features and the supervised output spaces, and is suitable for classification as well as regression tasks. The FL aggregation operations support system (OSS) server then uses the reported dataset entropies to devise 1) an entropy-based federated averaging scheme, and 2) a stochastic participant selection policy to significantly stabilize the training, minimize the convergence time, and reduce the corresponding computation cost. Numerical results are provided to show the superiority of these novel approaches. Copyright © 2021 Aamer, Chergui, Benjillali and Verikoukis.},

It delivers a toolkit of five open-source software tools and FAIR graph datasets covering the sustainable lifecycle of processing extreme data as MGs. The tools focus on holistic usability (from extreme data ingestion and MG creation), automated intelligence (through analytics and reasoning), performance modelling, and environmental sustainability tradeoffs, supported by credible data-driven evidence across the computing continuum. The automated operation uses the emerging serverless computing paradigm for efficiency and event responsiveness. Thus, it supports experienced and novice stakeholders from a broad group of large and small organisations to capitalise on extreme data through MG programming and processing. Graph-Massivizer validates its innovation on four complementary use cases considering their extreme data properties and coverage of the three sustainability pillars (economy, society, and environment): sustainable green finance, global environment protection foresight, green AI for the sustainable automotive industry, and data centre digital twin for exascale computing. Graph-Massivizer promises 70% more efficient analytics than AliGraph, and 30 % improved energy awareness for extract, transform and load storage operations than Amazon Redshift. Furthermore, it aims to demonstrate a possible two-fold improvement in data centre energy efficiency and over 25 % lower greenhouse gas emissions for basic graph operations. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Preterm infants’ spontaneous movements monitoring is a valuable ally to early recognise neuro-motor impairments, especially common in infants born before term. Currently, highly-specialized clinicians assess the movements quality on the basis of subjective, discontinuous, and time-consuming observations. To support clinicians, automatic monitoring systems have been developed, among which Deep Learning algorithms (mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) are up-to-date the most suitable and less invasive ones. Indeed, research in this field has devised highly reliable models, but has shown a tendency to neglect their computational costs. In fact, these models usually require massive computations, which, in turn, require expensive hardware and are environmentally unsustainable. As a consequence, the costs of these models risk to make their application to the actual clinical practice a privilege. However, the ultimate goal of research, especially in healthcare, should be designing technologies that are fairly accessible to as many people as possible. In light of this, this work analyzes three CNNs for preterm infants’ movements monitoring on the basis of their computational requirements. The two best-performing networks achieve very similar accuracy (Dice Similarity Coefficient around 0.88) although one of them, which was designed by us following the principles of Green AI, requires half as many Floating Point Operations (47 × 10 9 vs 101 × 10 9 ). Our research show that it is possible to design highly-performing and cost-efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for clinical applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Having a system that can take an image of a natural scene and accurately classify the plants in it is of undeniable importance. However, the complexities of dealing with natural scene images and the vast diversity of plants in the wild make designing such a classifier a challenging task. Deep Learning (DL) lends itself as viable solution to tackle such complex problem. However, advanced in DL architectures and software (including DL frameworks) come with a high cost in terms of energy consumption especially when employing Graphics Processing Units (GPU). As data expands rapidly, the need to create energy-aware models increases in order to reduce energy consumption and move towards “Greener AI”. Since the problem of designing energy-aware architectures for plant classification has not been studied significantly in the literature, our work comes to start bridging this gap by focusing not only on the models’ performance, but also on their energy usage on both CPU and GPU platforms. We consider different state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures and train them on two famous challenging plants datasets: iNaturalist and Herbarium. Our experiments are meant to highlight the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption. For examples, the results show that while GPU-bound models can be about 40% faster in terms of training time than simple models running on CPU, the latter’s energy consumption is only two thirds of the former. We hope that such findings will encourage the community to reduce its reliance on accuracy measures to compare different architectures and start taking other factors into account such as power consumption, simplicity, etc. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This study designed a survey to collect 1018 samples of educated people with access to the internet in Taiwan regarding their perceptions of AI and its connections to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The re-spondents showed high confidence in their AI knowledge. They had a very positive attitude toward AI but at the same time thought AI was risky. In general, people in Taiwan could be “rational opti-mists” regarding AI. We also examined how people think of the linkages between AI and the SDGs and found that SDG 4, SDG 9, and SDG 3 had the highest “synergy” and lowest rates of “trade-off”. Significant differences for some key questions were also identified concerning the demographic var-iables such as gender, age, education, and college major.

In this context, resource efficiency can directly lead to significant advancements in the ecological performance of manufacturing companies. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) also plays an increasingly important role. However, the potential influence of AI applications on resource efficiency has not been investigated. Against this back-ground, this article provides an overview of thecurrent AI applications and how they affect resource efficiency. In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this paper identifies, categorizes, and analyzes seventy papers with a focus on AI tasks, AI methods, business units, and their influence on resource efficiency. Only a minority of papers was found to address resource efficiency as an explicit objective. Subsequently, typical use cases of the identified AI applications are described with a focus on predictive maintenance, production planning, fault detection and predictive quality, as well as the increase in energy efficiency. In general, more research is needed that explicitly considers sustainability in the development and use phase of AI solutions, including Green AI. This paper contributes to research in this field by systematically examining papers and revealing research deficits. Additionally, practitioners are offered the first indications of AI applications increasing resource efficiency. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The field of AI has reported remarkable progress on a broad range of capabilities including object recognition, game playing, speech recognition, and machine translation. Much of this progress has been achieved by increasingly large and computationally intensive deep learning models. An important study has estimated the carbon footprint of several NLP models and argued this trend is both environmentally unfriendly and prohibitively expensive, raising barriers to participation in NLP research, which is known as Red AI. An alternative is Green AI, which treats efficiency as a primary evaluation criterion along with accuracy. To measure efficiency, we suggest reporting the number of floating-point operations required to generate a result. Green AI research will decrease AI’s environmental footprint and increase its inclusivity.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the legal conditions under which governments may use green artificial intelligence (AI) in city planning. Although Japan was one of the early countries to release its general AI principles, it has been relatively slow in establishing conditions where administrative agencies may use AI. Granted, there have been some recent scholarship that discusses the usage of AI in general under Japanese administrative law, but the use of green AI in city planning under Japanese law has not yet been discussed. Hence, this paper intends to focus on green AI in city planning and discuss the conditions for usage based on different categories of AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts a legal analysis on the utilization of AI for the purpose of sustainable city planning and administration in Japan. The approach of this paper is to summarize the existing scholarship in Japanese administrative law and analyse the new elements in the new field of green AI in city planning. This paper is not a natural science paper. The social science method of jurisprudence is used. This paper cites only public sources, and no informal literature has been referenced. Findings: This paper establishes the conditions where Japanese central and local government may use green AI in city planning from a legal viewpoint based on three categories. The categories are green AI usage in city planning concerning things, green AI usage in city planning concerning people and green AI usage in city planning concerning automated decision-making. Research limitations: This research is limited to an analysis of Japanese law, which means that issues other than law are not included in this paper. Further, although general legal issues are discussed, this paper is intended to discuss Japanese law issues only, and foreign laws are not discussed. Therefore, this paper mostly cites Japanese language papers published in domestic journals. Practical implications: The intended practical implication of this paper is to allow central and local governments to determine – based on the proposed categories – whether green AI can be used for city planning purposes and under which conditions. The authors hope that this will assist the Japanese government in establishing rules on the usage of AI by governmental agencies and allow for the greater actual usage by Japanese central and local governments of green AI in future city planning. Social implications: As the theme of this paper deals with governmental use (and the function of a government is to serve society), the social implications at issue can be said to be equivalent to the practical implication. Originality/value: There have been articles discussing Japanese administrative law restrictions on AI in general. However, as of now, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no articles published focusing on green AI used for city planning. The authors note that the green AI used for city planning would have different legal implications from AI’s usage by the government in general, such as the chatbot used by the agencies or lethal autonomous weapons by the military force. Therefore, this paper is original in focusing on green AI used for city planning. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The fundamental problem of determining the ro-bustness of a DNN with respect to its energy consumption (energy robustness) is relatively unexplored compared to accuracy-based ro-bustness. This work investigates the energy robustness of Adaptive Neural Networks (AdNNs), a type of energy-saving DNNs proposed for many energy-sensitive domains and have recently gained traction. We propose EREBA, the first black-box testing method for determining the energy robustness of an AdNN. EREBA explores and infers the relationship between inputs and the energy con-sumption of AdNN s to generate energy surging samples. Extensive implementation and evaluation using three state-of-the-art AdNNs demonstrate that test inputs generated by EREBA could degrade the performance of the system substantially. The test inputs gener-ated by EREBA can increase the energy consumption of AdNN s by 2,000% compared to the original inputs. Our results also show that test inputs generated via EREBA are valuable in detecting energy surging inputs. © 2022 ACM.},

While innovations and applications from A.I. have brought significant advances, from applications to vision and natural language to improvements to fields like medical imaging and materials engineering, their costs should not be neglected. As we embrace a world with ever-increasing amounts of data as well as research & development of A.I. applications, we are sure to face an ever-mounting energy footprint to sustain these computational budgets, data storage needs, and more. But, is this sustainable and, more importantly, what kind of setting is best positioned to nurture such sustainable A.I. in both research and practice? In this paper, we outline our outlook for Green A.I. - a more sustainable, energy-efficient and energy-aware ecosystem for developing A.I. across the research, computing, and practitioner communities alike - and the steps required to arrive there. We present a bird's eye view of various areas for potential changes and improvements from the ground floor of AI's operational and hardware optimizations for datacenter/HPCs to the current incentive structures in the world of A.I. research and practice, and more. We hope these points will spur further discussion, and action, on some of these issues and their potential solutions.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In this work, we consider a medical imaging reconstruction task from subsampled measurements, which is an active research field where Convolutional Neural Networks have already revealed their great potential.

Inspired by the ideas of the green AI literature, we propose a shallow neural network to perform efficient Learned Post-Processing on images roughly reconstructed by the filtered backprojection algorithm. The results show that the proposed inexpensive network computes images of comparable (or even higher) quality in about one-fourth of time and is more robust than the widely used and very deep ResUNet for tomographic reconstructions from sparse-view protocols. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cloud datacenters capable of provisioning high performance Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) at reduced resource cost is achieved via auto-tuning: automated tensor program optimization of Deep Learning models to minimize inference latency within a hardware device. However given the extensive heterogeneity of Deep Learning models, libraries, and hardware devices, performing auto-tuning within Cloud datacenters incurs a significant time, compute resource, and energy cost of which state-of-the-art auto-tuning is not designed to mitigate. In this paper we propose Trimmer, a high performance and cost-efficient Deep Learning auto-tuning framework for Cloud datacenters. Trimmer maximizes DL model performance and tensor program cost-efficiency by preempting tensor program implementations exhibiting poor optimization improvement; and applying an ML-based filtering method to replace expensive low performing tensor programs to provide greater likelihood of selecting low latency tensor programs. Through an empirical study exploring the cost of DL model optimization techniques, our analysis indicates that 26-43% of total energy is expended on measuring tensor program implementations that do not positively contribute towards auto-tuning. Experiment results show that Trimmer achieves high auto-tuning cost-efficiency across different DL models, and reduces auto-tuning energy use by 21.8-40.9% for Cloud clusters whilst achieving DL model latency equivalent to state-of-the-art techniques.  © 2022 IEEE.},

They are based on energy consumption measurements, on deep learning inference, on recognition gradients, and on number of classes and thus universally balance accuracy, complexity and energy consumption. Well-designed edge accelerators improve recognition and training efficiencies compared to cloud CPUs and GPUs due to reduced communication overhead. Cradle to grave sustainability of edge intelligence models and platforms is assessed with novel deep learning lifecycle efficiency and life cycle recognition efficiency metrics that include the number of times models are used.

	abstract = {With the growing availability of large-scale datasets, and the popularization of affordable storage and computational capabilities, the energy consumed by AI is becoming a growing concern. To address this issue, in recent years, studies have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question.To fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data-centric approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset modifications (number of data points and number of features).Our results show evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results, we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved.In conclusion, this exploratory investigation empirically demonstrates the importance of applying data-centric techniques to improve AI energy efficiency. Our results call for a research agenda that focuses on data-centric techniques, to further enable and democratize Green AI.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To design sustainable AI designers must be able to understand and think about complex technical, ecological, social, and economic systems and their interactions. Their reasoning and decisions need to be based on ethics and scientific facts. They must acknowledge different stakeholders’ social and cultural norms, practices and current and future needs. Unfortunately, designers’ thinking is prone to err, biases, and other psychological phenomena, which can negatively affect how they understand, reason, and make decision, and which can lead to unsustainable and unethical AI solutions. Thus, it is important to investigate errors in designers’ thinking. This study presents a cognitive scientific overview about some common errors when making arguments, inferring, and reasoning, when drawing analogies, or in situations where problems are complex, uncertain, challenging the status quo, or framed differently. Also, processing information, emotions and social and cultural aspects can be source of errors in thinking. Designers must become aware of the risk of errors in their own perceptions, thinking, and reasoning and to explain why, what, and how they design sustainable AI. This can lead to more ethical and sustainable solutions in AI design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Ethics, explainability, responsibility, and accountability are important concepts for questioning the societal impacts of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI), but are insufficient to guide the public sector in regulating and implementing AI. Recent frameworks for AI governance help to operationalize these by identifying the processes and layers of governance in which they must be considered, but do not provide public sector workers with guidance on how they should be pursued or understood. This analysis explores how the concept of sustainable AI can help to fill this gap. It does so by reviewing how the concept has been used by the research community and aligning research on sustainable development with research on public sector AI. Doing so identifies the utility of boundary conditions that have been asserted for social sustainability according to the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development, and which are here integrated with prominent concepts from the discourse on AI and society. This results in a conceptual model that integrates five boundary conditions to assist public sector decision-making about how to govern AI: Diversity, Capacity for learning, Capacity for self-organization Common meaning, and Trust. These are presented together with practical approaches for their presentation, and guiding questions to aid public sector workers in making the decisions that are required by other operational frameworks for ethical AI. © 2022},

	abstract = {Research on AI tends to analytically separate technical and social issues, viewing AI first as a technical object that only later, after it has been implemented, may have social consequences. This commentary paper discusses how some of the challenges of AI research relate to the gap between technological and social analyses, and it proposes steps ahead for how to practically achieve prosperous collaborations for future AI research. The discussion draws upon three examples to illustrate the analytical gap in different phases of the development of AI systems. Attending to the planning phase, the first example highlights the risk of oversimplifying the task for an AI system by not incorporating a social analysis at the outset of the development. The second example illuminates the issue of system acceptance, where the paper elaborates on why acceptance is multifaceted and need not be approached as merely a technical problem. With the third example, the paper notes that AI systems may change a practice, suggesting that a continuous analysis of such changes is necessary for projects to maintain relevance as well as to consider the broader impact of the developed technology. The paper argues that systematic and substantial social analyses should be integral to AI development. Exploring the connections between an AI’s technical design and its social implications is key to ensuring feasible and sustainable AI systems that benefit society. The paper calls for further multi-disciplinary research initiatives that explore new ways to close the analytical gap between technical and social approaches to AI. © 2021, The Author(s).},
