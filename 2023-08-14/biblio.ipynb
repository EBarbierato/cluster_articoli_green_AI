      "    ('abstract', 'Abstract While there is a growing effort towards AI for Sustainability (e.g. towards the sustainable development goals) it is time to move beyond that and to address the sustainability of developing and using AI systems. In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI for sustainability and sustainability of AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment—to remember that there are environmental costs to AI. Further, to direct funding towards sustainable methods of AI.'), \n",

      "    ('abstract', 'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness on the need for a more comprehensive approach on the interdependence between artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental sustainability. It provides an overview of existing sustainable AI policy initiatives at the national and regional level. More precisely, it discusses whether existing European Union (EU) environmental policies are suitable for the AI era or whether new regulations are needed in this field. Finally, this paper assesses cross-fertilisation opportunities between the EU and non-EU countries. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a qualitative analysis of sustainable applications of AI and the sustainability of AI. Emphasis is laid on the latter, and a “sustainable by design” approach is proposed, which in essence is a prerequisite for transparent, responsible and human-centred AI systems. The analysis primarily focuses on environmental sustainability. Findings The majority of studies focus on how to use AI to protect the environment with very little attention paid to sustainable design of AI. On the other hand, the EU’s comprehensive approach towards sustainable AI is closest to promoting “sustainable by design” AI. Several ways have been identified in which the EU’s actions can be translated beyond its borders. Research limitations/implications One of the largest limitations of this study is its moderate scope. This paper is confined to the EU and as such provides a limited assessment of global policies and measures on the interplay between sustainability and AI. Consequently, the paper did not provide an in-depth analysis of environmental policies worldwide that could help provide a better picture of possible cooperation areas or common grounds. Another limitation of this study is that it primarily focuses on environmental aspects and as such accords little attention to the economic and social pillars of sustainability. Social implications With less than 1\n",
      "    0 years to go before reaching the sustainable development goal deadline, this study can help stakeholders better understand what is being done worldwide in terms of sustainable AI. Moreover, given that the technology is still in its early phase, this study can inspire a “sustainable by design” approach to the development of AI technologies. Originality/value All national AI strategies published by 1 June 2021 were analysed to identify whether and to what extent they prioritise the interplay between environment and AI. Furthermore, the authors also looked at the EU policy and how it aims to address AI from a sustainable perspective.'), \n",

These risks have led to proposed regulations, litigation, and general societal concerns. As with any promising technology, organizations want to benefit from the positive capabilities of AI technology while reducing the risks. The best way to reduce risks is to implement comprehensive AI lifecycle governance where policies and procedures are described and enforced during the design, development, deployment, and monitoring of an AI system. While support for comprehensive governance is beginning to emerge, organizations often need to identify the risks of deploying an already-built model without knowledge of how it was constructed or access to its original developers. Such an assessment will quantitatively assess the risks of an existing model in a manner analogous to how a home inspector might assess the energy efficiency of an already-built home or a physician might assess overall patient health based on a battery of tests.

This paper describes the paradox of an energy-consuming technology serving the ecological challenges of tomorrow. The study provides an overview of the sectors that use AI-based solutions for environmental protection. It draws on numerous examples from AI for Green players to present use cases and concrete examples. In the second part of the study, the negative impacts of AI on the environment and the emerging technological solutions to support Green AI are examined. It is also shown that the research on less energy-consuming AI is motivated more by cost and energy autonomy constraints than by environmental considerations. This leads to a rebound effect that favors an increase in the complexity of models. Finally, the need to integrate environmental indicators into algorithms is discussed. The environmental dimension is part of the broader ethical problem of AI, and addressing it is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of AI in the long term.'), \n",

      "    w years. Arguably their most significant impact has been in the area of computer vision where great advances have been made in challenges such as plausible image generation, image-to-image translation, facial attribute manipulation, and similar domains. Despite the significant successes achieved to date, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here. These are as follows: (1) the generation of high quality images, (2) diversity of image generation, and (3) stabilizing training. Focusing on the degree to which popular GAN technologies have made progress against these challenges, we provide a detailed review of the state-of-the-art in GAN-related research in the published scientific literature. We further structure this review through a convenient taxonomy we have adopted based on variations in GAN architectures and loss functions. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have considered the status of this field based on their progress toward addressing practical challenges relevant to computer vision. Accordingly, we review and critically discuss the most popular architecture-variant, and loss-variant GANs, for tackling these challenges. Our objective is to provide an overview as well as a critical analysis of the status of GAN research in terms of relevant progress toward critical computer vision application requirements. As we do this we also discuss the most compelling applications in computer vision in which GANs have demonstrated considerable success along with some suggestions for future research directions. Codes related to the GAN-variants studied in this work is summarized on https://github.com/sheqi/GAN\\\\_Review.'), \n",

As a branch of machine learning, DTL applies end-to-end learning to overcome the drawback of traditional machine learning that regards each dataset individually. Although some valuable and impressive general surveys exist on TL, special attention and recent advances in DTL are lacking. In this survey, we first review more than 50 representative approaches of DTL in the last decade and systematically summarize them into four categories. In particular, we further divide each category into subcategories according to models, functions, and operation objects. In addition, we discuss recent advances in TL in other fields and unsupervised TL. Finally, we provide some possible and exciting future research directions.'), \n",

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.\"), \n",

Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115\\\\%, with savings over 50\\\\% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.'), \n",

It can be viewed as a broader effort to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that interacts with them. The capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model. However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search engines, are discrete. We examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape, an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple algorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to make our model Turing complete.'), \n",

It can move a head by either providing a new address in the key space (aka random access) or moving from its previous position via a Lie group action (aka Lie access). In this way, the \"L\" and \"R\" instructions of a traditional Turing Machine are generalized to arbitrary elements of a fixed Lie group action. For this reason, we name this new model the Lie Access Neural Turing Machine, or LANTM. We tested two different configurations of LANTM against an LSTM baseline in several basic experiments.

Inspired by the success of stack augmented RNN (StackRNN) to generate strings for various applications, we present two memory augmented RNN-based architectures: the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) for the de-novo generation of small molecules. We trained a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the properties of a generated string and compute a reward or loss in a deep reinforcement learning setup to bias the Generator to produce molecules with the desired property. Further, we compare the performance of these architectures to gain insight to their relative merits in terms of the validity and novelty of the generated molecules and the degree of property bias towards the computational generation of de-novo drugs. We also compare the performance of these architectures with simpler recurrent neural networks (Vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU) without an external memory component to explore the impact of augmented memory in the task of de-novo generation of small molecules.'), \n",

While tensors first emerged in the psychometrics community in the \\\\$20{\\\\textasciicircum}\\\\{{\\\\textbackslash}text\\\\{th\\\\}\\\\}\\\\$ century, they have since then spread to numerous other disciplines, including machine learning. Tensors and their decompositions are especially beneficial in unsupervised learning settings, but are gaining popularity in other sub-disciplines like temporal and multi-relational data analysis, too. The scope of this paper is to give a broad overview of tensors, their decompositions, and how they are used in machine learning. As part of this, we are going to introduce basic tensor concepts, discuss why tensors can be considered more rigid than matrices with respect to the uniqueness of their decomposition, explain the most important factorization algorithms and their properties, provide concrete examples of tensor decomposition applications in machine learning, conduct a case study on tensor-based estimation of mixture models, talk about the current state of research, and provide references to available software libraries.'), \n",

We consider general multilinear and multihomogeneous tensors. We show how to reduce the problem to a truncated moment matrix problem and give a new criterion for flat extension of Quasi-Hankel matrices. We connect this criterion to the commutation characterization of border bases. A new algorithm is described. It applies for general multihomogeneous tensors, extending the approach on binary forms by J.J. Sylvester. An example illustrates the algebraic operations involved in this approach and how the decomposition can be recovered from eigenvector computation.'), \n",
